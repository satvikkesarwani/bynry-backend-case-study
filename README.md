Part 1: Create Product API (create_product)
Changes Made

Input Validation Added

Required fields (name, sku) checked.

price validated as decimal and cannot be negative.

initial_quantity validated as a non-negative integer.

SKU Uniqueness Check

Prevents creation of duplicate products with the same SKU.

Transaction Safety

Used db.session.flush() to get product.id before creating inventory.

Wrapped DB operations in try/except with rollback on failure.

Product â†” Inventory Linking

Product created globally (unique SKU).

Inventory created per warehouse.

If inventory exists, stock is incremented instead of creating duplicates.

Meaningful API Responses

Returns success message + product ID, SKU, warehouse ID, and quantity.

Returns clear error messages (400 for validation, 409 for duplicates, 500 for server issues).

ðŸ’¡ Logic

Separation of product definition and inventory ensures clean data modeling.

Validation ensures system integrity (no negative prices/stock, no duplicates).

Rollbacks protect database consistency.








Part 2: Database Schema (database.py)
Changes Made

Normalization

Created three tables:

products (global info)

warehouses (locations)

inventories (stock levels)

Relationships

Product â†” Inventory = one-to-many.

Warehouse â†” Inventory = one-to-many.

Together, this models a many-to-many relationship between products and warehouses.

Constraints

sku marked unique at database level.

quantity defaults to 0.

ðŸ’¡ Logic

Keeps data normalized and scalable (a product can be in many warehouses).

Enforces business rules at schema level (unique SKUs, valid foreign keys).

Prevents accidental duplicate product-warehouse mappings.







Part 3: Low Stock Endpoint (get_low_stock)
 Changes Made

Configurable Threshold

Query param ?threshold=VALUE (default = 10).

Optional Warehouse Filter

Query param ?warehouse_id=ID to restrict results to one warehouse.

Structured Response

Returns list of items:

{
  "product_id": 1,
  "sku": "ABC123",
  "name": "Laptop",
  "warehouse_id": 2,
  "quantity": 5
}


Includes count of total low-stock items.

ðŸ’¡ Logic

Threshold flexibility supports different alerting policies.

Warehouse filter helps managers focus on their branch.

JSON format is frontend-friendly for dashboards.









Assumptions Made

SKU is unique across the system.

Product can exist in multiple warehouses, but inventory is warehouse-specific.

Negative stock is not allowed (no backorders).

Price may be optional during product creation.

Warehouse IDs provided are assumed valid (basic validation not shown).

Authentication/authorization is not in scope for this case study.
